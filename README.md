# sporttrade_project
Repo created for Sporttrade IaC Project. I used this exercise to create my kvm /libvirtd enviornment on my ubiuntu laptop and from there use terraform, ansible, and cloud init to pull and deploy a CentOS image (terraform), add user information to the instance via password and ssh keys (cloud-init) and then provision Nginx on it(ansible). I also used the terraform libvirtd provider as well to help tie everything together on my local machine. This is something I can re-use going forward so thanks for this project as this helped me finally get something done I have been meaning to do for awhile :-).
